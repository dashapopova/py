## Homework assignment 3

HW 3 is due 06.10 before 23:59 

Please e-mail your homework to daschapopowa@gmail.com in a .pdf or an .html format (please use R Markdown to create your file)

### Task 1 -- 4 points

**Please don't forget to provide code for every step!**

Take the data from a frequency dictionary [Ляшевская, Шаров 2011](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agricolamz/DS_for_DH/master/data/freq_dict_2011.csv)

Use the data in the lemma column to compute how many times each character has occurred in the dictionary.

Then, recreate the plot below (don't forget the source of the data at the bottom of the plot):

If you want to use English data, take any of our English datasets, e.g., the heroes dataset, and do all of the above, e.g., compute and plot the number of times each character (letter) has occurred in the names of the superheroes.

### Task 2 -- 4 points

**Please don't forget to provide code for every step!**

Take [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agricolamz/DS_for_DH/master/data/us_city_average_temperature.csv) the data on 51 US cities, their population (the number of people),  the minimum and the maximum monthly temperature for each city in Fahrenheit. Turn Fahrenheit into Celsius and find the minimum temperature in the dataset (across all the cities and all the months).

Then, recreate the plot below:

### For a 9 or a 10 -- 2 points

Create your own homework problem that targets the topic of functions. Provide a dataset, a problem formulation and a solution. Successful homework problems will be included in the next year's homework for students to solve.

Typically, a 9 and a 10 are reserved for students who show exceptional knowledge, skills and enthusiasm for the assignment.
