## Homework assignment 1

Create 5 plots for the data in [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dashapopova/Intro-to-R/main/HWs/heroes_information.csv)

Maximum per plot -- 2 points: 

+ there are comments upon the choice of the plot,
+ there is a description of the plot,
+ the plot type is suitable for your goal, 
+ the data on the plot are readable, 
+ there is complexity to the plot (the type of the plot, the subset of the data you took, the labels, the legend, the colours, the sizes, the sorting, the variation in the plot types you have used),
+ you get up to maximum points if all of the above is done plus the type of the plot is not one of the types we have covered in class
