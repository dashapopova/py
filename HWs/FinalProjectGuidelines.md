## Final Project Guidelines

Final Project is the exam for this class

**Please e-mail me your work by 23:59 on October 20th in .html or .pdf format**

The general idea: data exploration -- a mini-study of a dataset: 

+ you take a dataset, 
+ come up with a couple of hypotheses, 
+ manipulate and plot the data to test the hypotheses, 
+ comment on the results
+ **present your work in class on Oct 21st (10-15 min with questions, not optional! I won't be able to give you a grade for your final project unless you present your work)**

+ 8 points: your work represents a small, but coherent study of the dataset: there are at least two hypotheses; there are different data manipulations that use regular expressions, your own functions, data selection etc.; there are at least four plots and at least three different plot types; there are comments on the steps you make and explanations why you make them; you present your work on the October 21st, you can just walk us through your file, no need to create a separate presentation

+ 9-10 points: all of the above + you use something that we haven't discussed in class, or your plots/functions/other manipulations are really complex

+ you can work on your project in groups of 2, a group project can receive max. 8 points, unless it is exceptionally complex

Datasets:

+ you can take your own dataset or any dataset available on the internet ([A list of free datasets](https://r-dir.com/reference/datasets.html))
+ you can further explore any of the datasets that we have worked with in class
+ [DraCor](https://dracor.org/): a Drama Corpus, contains files for a number of dramas for a number of languages, including Russian, English, but also Italian, German etc.
+ [Princess Corpus](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vVkkpcZehzD5bOyoES5hM7hrO2SUpvWS) created by Lelia Glass
+ [Sociolinguistic data collected in Moscow schools](https://github.com/dashapopova/Intro-to-R/blob/main/HWs/Schools_results2016-17_6Mar2018.xlsx)
+ [The result of the morphological analysis of "War and Peace"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dashapopova/Intro-to-R/main/HWs/tolstoy.csv)
