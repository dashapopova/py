## Final Project Guidelines

The general idea: data exploration -- a mini-study of a dataset: 

+ you take a dataset, 
+ come up with a couple of hypotheses, 
+ manipulate and plot the data to test the hypotheses, 
+ comment on the results

Datasets:

+ you can take your own dataset or any dataset available on the internet
+ you can further explore any of the datasets that we have worked with in class
+ [DraCor](https://dracor.org/): a Drama Corpus, contains file for a number of dramas for a number of languages, including Russian, English, but also Italian, German etc.
+ [Princess Corpus](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vVkkpcZehzD5bOyoES5hM7hrO2SUpvWS) created by Lelia Glass
