**For 6 points:**
1) The pragmatic listener, upon hearing the word 'glasses', is very likely to pick the r1 option. This is because a pragmatic listener is thinking about what a pragmatic speaker would say, and adjusts the probabilities accordingly
2) When we change initial probabilities, the pragmatic listener interpretation gets skewed towards 'hat' more likely denoting the R2, the implicature will not be computed:

|            | r1   | r2   | r3  |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| 'hat'      | 0.33 | 0.67 | 0   |
| 'glasses'  | 0    | 0    | 1   |
| 'mustache' | 0    | 1    | 0   |

1) An example of an two-scale SI-game: three houses, two parameters: color (white, yellow), front window (yes/no). As a result, we have two scales: one is \<WINDOW > WHITE> and \<YELLOW > WINDOW>
2) The higher the alpha, the stronger the implicature; the lower probability of the less informative item, the less likely the implicature is to be computed; the higher the cost, the lower the probability for the speaker saying the word. Speaking of the combination of the factors, alpha alone is not enough to overpower the cost and the initial probabilities
3) The difference is that now only one word has a definite referent

| HOUSE1 | HOUSE2       | HOUSE3       |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| white  | white        | yellow       |
| â€”      | front.window | front.window |
 
|             | r1       | r2       | r3  |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | --- |
| white       | 0.666667 | 0.333333 | 0.0 |
| yellow      | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 1.0 |
| with window | 0.000000 | 0.600000 | 0.4 |

**+2 points:**
1) Synonym usage (e.g. someone accidentally uses 'cap' instead of 'hat'
2) We could assign a lower probability to the synonym that is less likely
